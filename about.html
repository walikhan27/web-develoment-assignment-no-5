    <p>Hi, I’m Wali! I’m new to programming and have just started my journey by learning HTML. I’m excited about
        becoming a software engineer and am eager to expand my skills further by diving into CSS and JavaScript next. I
        find coding fascinating because it empowers me to create and solve problems.
        I’m particularly interested in full-stack development and look forward to mastering both front-end and back-end
        technologies. I believe in the power of collaboration and enjoy engaging with others in the coding community.
        Outside of coding, I love playing cricket, listening to music, and writing poetry. These hobbies inspire my
        creativity and help me recharge. I’m excited to see where my programming journey will take me!</p>
